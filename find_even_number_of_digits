# 1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

# Here is another solution that I cam up with for Leetcode # 1295

# The task is to count how many numbers have an even amount of digits and return the amount. 
# For example in the list [232, 34, 21, 10], we would return 3.
# The goal is to find the length of each number by turning it into a string, because the len function does not work on type int!
# Next, we see if the length is even by seeing if it has a reminder when divided by 2. 
# If the number has an even length, add it to the counter variable and return it. 


class Solution:
    def findNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for number in nums:
            if len(str(number)) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
        return count
